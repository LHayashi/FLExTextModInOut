This is a repo for some ongoing work to create richer FLExText export including audio offsets and meta-data from the Notebook records that own Interlinear Texts.

# FLExTextModInOut
Transforms for adding begin and end offsets as a custom field "InOut" in FieldWorks/FLEx interlinear
Both of these files need to be copied to C:\Program Files\SIL\FieldWorks 9\Language Explorer\Export Templates\Interlinear.
Refer to https://docs.google.com/document/d/1siYTatJtr95aSVpSzOK_pngChliIOFOSaNTYuK_3haI/edit?usp=sharing for detailed procedures.
